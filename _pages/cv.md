# Hyung-Bae Jeon
__PhD Evolutionary Biologist__

## Current Position
**Postdoctoral Fellow** *Concordia University, Montréal Canada*

## Research Interests
I have been studying to reconstruct the evolutionary history of freshwater fishes based on population genetics and phylogenetics tools using microsatellites, MHC and mtDNA. Now, I am interested in the genomic consequences of harvesting in fish (also known as ‘fisheries-induced evolution’), and I am working on introduced Brook trout to understand how populations evolve during harvesting. This study will contribute to establishing conservation strategies for endangered species as well as sustainable fisheries management
